### Installation
1. Clone the Repository: `https://github.com/darkstardevx/xresources-themes.git` to your desired location.
2. Change directories to `xresources-themes`
3. Now you can copy and move the files wherever you like.
   I like to put them in `.Xresources.themes`
   Add a link for the theme you want to use to your
   .Xresources file:
   `include "~/.Xresources-themes/theme-name.Xresources"`

### About
This is just something that I thought would be cool to do
for those who like to use different colors and just don't
have the time to make them. Enjoy!
